### Instructions for Running:
Since I used a discord bot as the frontend and that requires token-authenticated access to run as well as a connected discord server it may be hard to see the full program run as a discord bot so there is also an image of the output from the bot in the repo. To see the text output that the bot responds with to the user without the actual discord bot, simply calling `print(handle_response("{PLAYER_NAME}"))` in responses.py will show the full report in the terminal. There is an example of wide receiver Tyler Boyd but any skill position player will work.
